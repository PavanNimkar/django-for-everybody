## 📌 About This Repository

This repo contains **all my code, assignments, and mini-projects** from the Django for Everybody course.  

I took this specialization to **strengthen my back-end web development skills** and learn how to build full-stack applications with Python & Django.  
The course was **practical and project-based**, so you'll find functional Django apps here, from simple data-driven sites to more advanced CRUD applications.
